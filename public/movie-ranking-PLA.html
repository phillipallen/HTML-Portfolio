<h1>The Best Movies According to Phillip</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Malcom X</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie because it protrays the full life of Malcom X.</p>
<h3>Its a Wonderful life</h3>
<p>This is a timeless story of the importance of family and friends as a measure of wealth, rather than money.</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p> This was the first representation of an African super hero in a complex and respectful manner.</p>
